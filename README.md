# S6-Mini-Project (The AcademicTrust)
**The AcademicTrust** is a university website built on top of a university registry system, the added feature being that once a student completes his respective programme, his degree certificate will be published on the ethereum blockchain(sepolia tesnet in this project), and also this wesite contains a verification module for the employers who can verify the authenticity of the student certificates before hiring.
